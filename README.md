## About
The Essentials library delivers functionality, performance and pushes the limits of what is possible with Khan Academy's Processing.js environment. Essentials is a one-of-a-kind library designed to make the programming experience on Khan less about working around it's restrictions and more about transforming your ideas into reality.

### Why
Khan Academy doesn't offer an equivalent of modules, leaving it to programmers to reinvent the wheel for themselves even for the most trivial of tasks. Not to mention the [countless](https://khanacademy.org/cs/-/5836386270134272) [bugs](https://ka-hearth.learnerpages.com/posts/new-memory-leak) that Khan's port of Processing.js has been [riddled](https://github.com/Khan/live-editor/issues) with. Most of which, mind you, have been long patched on the original repository. Although most of these are completely irreparable, others have workarounds which are included with the library.

### Technologies
The Essentials library uses the following open-source projects:
 - [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
 - [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
 - [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
 - [Terser](https://terser.org/)

A list of all dependencies defined in [package.json](https://github.com/bhavjitChauhan/Essentials/blob/master/package.json) and [package-lock.json](https://github.com/bhavjitChauhan/Essentials/blob/master/package-lock.json) is available in the [Dependency graph](https://github.com/bhavjitChauhan/Essentials/network/dependencies).

## Getting Started
Create a [new program](https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/new/) on Khan Academy or use an existing project and paste the following boilerplate code:

```js
// jshint ignore: start
$.ajaxSetup({ cache: true });
$.getScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bhavjitChauhan/essentials@2/essentials.min.js',
    function() {
        // your code here
    }
);
```

See alternative methods in the [Integration](https://bhavjitchauhan.github.io/Essentials/tutorial-Integration) tutorial.

### Customize
The recommended method to generate any boilerplate code for the Essentials library is to use the [Builder](https://bhavjitchauhan.github.io/Essentials/tutorial-Builder). See other ways of reducing file sizes and load times in the [Customize](https://bhavjitchauhan.github.io/Essentials/tutorial-Customize) tutorial.

## Usage
After loading the Essentials library its functions and constants are defined in the global scope, they can be called directly.

For live examples, please refer the [Integration](https://bhavjitchauhan.github.io/Essentials/tutorial-Integration) tutorial.
